        <h1>Play with Spring & Jinq</h1>
        <h5>This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.playframework.com">Play</a> with
            <a href="http://spring.io">Spring</a>, and uses
            <a href="http://www.jinq.org">Jinq</a> to query the in-memory database. This is a short tutorial that assumes you are already familiar with the basic workings of a Play application.</h5>

        <h3>The Domain Model</h3>
        <p>For simplicity's sake, this a single entity app. There is a Movie class with three attributes - ID, title and created date. The ID and title speak for themselves, and the created date is the date in which the movie was persisted to the database.
            Play synthesises getters and setters so we need not worry about these.
        </p>

    <div class="row">
        <h3>Repositories and the repository pattern</h3>
        <p>
            We have created a <a href="#code/app/repositories/MovieRepository.java">MovieRepository</a> interface (DAO) which will be injected into the
            <a href="#code/app/controllers/MoviesController.java">MoviesController</a> (we will look at that part in a bit). It is annotated with <code>@Named</code> to declare that the repository is available for dependency injection and <code>@Singleton</code> to declare that only one instance of it is generally required.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also have a <a href="#code/app/repositories/MovieRepositoryImpl.java">MovieRepositoryImpl</a> that implements the MovieRepository's methods. This contains the code that performs the does the dirty work in making requests to the database. Results, if any, are then returned to the MovieRepository DAO.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h3>Web Controllers</h3>
        <p>
            We have a single controller, aptly named <a href="#code/app/controllers/MoviesController.java">MoviesController</a> to give it some meaning. To indicate that this is a controller it is annotated with the Spring annotation <code>@Controller</code>. Through means of a constructor we have injected the MovieRepository DAO via the use of <code>@Inject</code>. We use constructor injection in order to promote an immutable programming model. Immutable variables assist toward providing an inherently thread-safe application.
        </p>

    <div class="row">
        <h3>Jinq</h3>
        <p>
            If you have ever used LINQ in C# you will love Jinq. Jinq provides developers an easy and natural way to write database queries in Java and Scala. You can treat database data like normal Java objects stored in collections. You can iterate over them and filter them using normal Java commands, and all your code will be automatically translated into optimized database queries.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have added a <a href="#code/app/configs/JinqSource.java">JinqSource</a> file which we declare in our repository for use. We have added the following helper method to query the Movie entity.
        </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                public JPAJinqStream&lt;Movie&gt; movies(EntityManager em) {
                return streams.streamAll(em, Movie.class);
                }
                </code>
            </pre>
